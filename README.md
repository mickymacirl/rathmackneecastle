## Design
### Colors
![Colors](/docs/color.jpg)

Using the color palette from the logo, which I generated from an image of the castle using the eye dropper in Adobe Photoshop, the dark green and a lighter brown fit each other well.

The dark green is used as a background and text color which contrasts well with the lighter brown of the navbar and footer. The main background is white, which makes the text content easier to read. 

*#b29e84 light brown* - Color used for navbar background, footer background, navbar hover over text color and font awesome hover over text color.

*#253439 dark green* – Color used for Logo background, navbar hover over, font awesome hover over and main body text color.

*#ffffff white* – Color used for elements of Logo and for main body background color.

### Social Media Icons

The icons for social media are from the Font Awesome library.  Choosing the square option when available. 

### Fonts

I've made the decision to use the imported Montserrat typeface from Google Fonts. https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/montserrat#details-section

I chose this typeface because, in my opinion, it blends nicely with the website's design and complements the font used in the logo which is Anton. https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/anton
