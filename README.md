# Design
## Colors
![Colors](/docs/color.jpg)

Using the color palette from the logo, which I generated from an image of the castle using the eye dropper in Adobe Photoshop, the dark green and a lighter brown fit each other well.

The dark green is used as a background and text color which contrasts well with the lighter brown of the navbar and footer. The main background is white, which makes the text content easier to read. 

*#b29e84 light brown* - Color used for navbar background, footer background, navbar hover over text color and font awesome hover over text color.

*#253439 dark green* – Color used for Logo background, navbar hover over, font awesome hover over and main body text color.

*#ffffff white* – Color used for elements of Logo and for main body background color.

## Social Media Icons

The icons for social media are from the Font Awesome library.  Choosing the square option when available. 

![Social Media Icons](/docs/sc1.jpg)

## Fonts

I've made the decision to use the imported *[Montserrat](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/montserrat#details-section)* typeface from Google Fonts for the main font of text and menus on the website.

I chose this typeface because, in my opinion, it blends nicely with the web site's design and complements the font used in the logo which is *[Anton](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/anton)*.

# Testing
## Responsiveness

Pages were tested on various different screen sizes from 320px on a Samsung fold 2, iPhone 11, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Nexus 7 and a wide screen Windows machine.

Pages were tested on most modern browsers including Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Brave.

**Test Steps:**

1.	Open the corresponding browser and open Rathmacknee Castle site.
2.	Open the browser development tools by hitting the corresponding dev tools shortcut.
3.	Resize to the desired width.
4.	Click and drag the browser window to lower or higher window size.

**Expected:**

The website is responsive on all sizes and no pixelation is accruing. No overlap of text or images.

**Actual:**

The website behaved as expected, with an initial issue with the center of text in the confirm.html page on a screen size of 700px. This issue is listed in the Bugs and Issues section below as being solved. 

The website was tested on the following physical devices, with no resizing issues seen:

* Samsung fold 2
* iPhone 11
* Samsung Galaxy Tab
* Nexus 7 with Kali Linux
* Widescreen 4k monitor

The website was tested on the following screen sizes using Chrome Dev tools and Unicorn Revealer:

* iPhone SE
* iPhone XR
* iPhone 12 PRO
* Pixel 5
* Samsung Galaxy S8+
* Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
* iPad Air
* iPad Mini
* Surface Pro 7
* Surface Duo
* Samsung Galaxy A51/71
* Nest Hub
* Nest Hub Max

# Accessibility

The *[WAVE Evaluation Website](https://wave.webaim.org/)* tool was used throughout the development of the site and checked at the final stages to ensure the highest possible level of accessibility that meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

Testing produced an alert on each page, this is due to an adjacent link on the logo and the navbar both going to index.html. The introduction of the link on the Logo generated this error but I believe as the site grows, and from other popular sites, multiple ways to go home can be useful to the user of the site. 

![Wave Results](/docs/waveresults.jpg)

On the History Page, the 3 YouTube video links have generated 3 alerts in relation to YouTube Captions being not ideal when using a screen reader. I could not find a fix for this.
