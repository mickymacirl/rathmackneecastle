      <h1>Rathmacknee Castle</h1>
      <p class="smallermain">Rathmacknee Castle some believed to have been built by John Rosseter (Rossiter, Rositer,
        Rosceter) who was made seneschal of the Liberty of Wexford in 1415.</p>
      <p class="smallermain">Other accounts associate its construction with his grandson Thomas Rossiter, Seneschal in
        1493. The Rossiters remained Catholic after the Reformation but stayed loyal to the monarchy and continued to
        hold their lands.</p>
      <p class="smallermain">Col. Thomas Rosseter fought against Oliver Cromwell at Wexford in the Irish Confederate
        Wars and the castle and lands were confiscated in 1654. The castle remained occupied until the 1760s. In the
        19th century it was restored by its owner, Hamilton Knox Grogan Morgan, who also owned the nearly Johnstown Castle estates.</p>
