        <h1>Rathmacknee Castle History</h1>
        <p class="smallermain">Rathmacknee Castle (Irish: Caislean Rath Mhic Naoi) was belived to be built by John
          Rosseter, who was made Seneschal of the Liberty of Wexford in 1415.</p>
        <p class="smallermain">Other accounts associate its construction with his grandson Thomas Rossiter, seneschal in
          1493. The Rossiters remained Catholic after the Reformation but stayed loyal to the monarchy and continued to
          hold their lands</p>
